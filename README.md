# To-Do List
This is a to-do list powered by Laravel  6 and VueJS. This application allows you to quickly create to-do list items on the fly.
 
 
 ## Installation 
 If you are installing this application on another server, you will need to generate an `.env` file with a valid database connection to a SQL database. After you have this set up, simply run `php artisan migrate` and the necessary tables will be set up for you.
